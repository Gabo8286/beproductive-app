- Include accessibility requirements upfront
- Mention any specific integrations required
- Specify if offline support is needed

#### When Setting Up APIs:
- Define the data structure clearly
- Specify real-time requirements
- Mention caching strategies needed
- Include error handling requirements

#### When Writing Tests:

### Key Design Patterns

#### Component Pattern
```typescript
// Functional component with TypeScript
export function ComponentName({ prop }: Props) {
  // Hooks at the top
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { isMobile } = useMobile();

  // Event handlers
  const handleAction = () => {};

  // Conditional rendering
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <Error />;

  // Main render
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

#### Service Pattern
```typescript
// Singleton service class
class ServiceName {
  private static instance: ServiceName;

  static getInstance() {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new ServiceName();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }

  async method() {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

#### Hook Pattern
```typescript
// Custom hook with React Query
export function useResource() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['resource'],
    queryFn: fetchResource,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}
```
