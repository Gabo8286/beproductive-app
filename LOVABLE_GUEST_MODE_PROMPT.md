# BeProductive v2 - Guest Mode Implementation for Lovable

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Implement a comprehensive guest mode system for BeProductive v2 that allows users to test and explore the application without requiring authentication. This system provides two distinct user experiences: Super Admin and Regular User, each with realistic demo data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Authentication Bypass**: Allow users to access the app without creating accounts
- **Two User Types**: Provide Super Admin and Regular User experiences
- **Demo Data**: Rich, realistic mock data for both user types
- **Development Mode**: Clear indicators that this is for testing/demo purposes
- **Easy Exit**: Simple way to return to normal authentication flow

### User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Access**: Users can explore features instantly
- **Realistic Demo**: Comprehensive data showcasing app capabilities
- **Clear Context**: Users understand they're in demo mode
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, intuitive interface elements

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create environment variables for guest mode control:

```env
# Guest Mode Configuration
VITE_ENABLE_GUEST_MODE=true
VITE_GUEST_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@guest.local
VITE_GUEST_USER_EMAIL=user@guest.local
```

**Production Settings**: Set `VITE_ENABLE_GUEST_MODE=false` for live deployments.

### 2. Guest Mode Utilities (`src/utils/auth/guestMode.ts`)

```typescript
export type GuestUserType = 'admin' | 'user';

export interface GuestModeConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  adminEmail: string;
  userEmail: string;
}

// Core functions needed:
export const isGuestModeEnabled = (): boolean;
export const createGuestUser = (type: GuestUserType): User;
export const createGuestSession = (type: GuestUserType): Session;
export const createGuestProfile = (type: GuestUserType): Profile;
export const isGuestUser = (user: User | null): boolean;
export const getGuestUserType = (user: User | null): GuestUserType | null;
```

### 3. Authentication Context Enhancement

Update your authentication context to support guest mode:

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // ... existing properties
  isGuestMode: boolean;
  guestUserType: GuestUserType | null;
  signInAsGuest: (type: GuestUserType) => void;
  clearGuestMode: () => void;
}

// Implementation priorities:
// 1. Check for saved guest mode selection on init
// 2. Create mock guest users with proper roles
// 3. Handle guest mode signout/clear functionality
// 4. Maintain guest mode state across page refreshes
```

### 4. Guest Mode Selection Component

Create a user-friendly selection interface for the login page:

**Design Requirements:**
- Two distinct cards for Admin vs User
- Feature comparison between user types
- Professional development mode indicators
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Visual distinction with icons and colors

**Features to Highlight:**
- **Super Admin**: Full access, team management, advanced analytics, system configuration
- **Regular User**: Personal productivity, task management, basic features, goal tracking

### 5. Guest Mode Indicator

Create a persistent indicator shown when in guest mode:

**UI Elements:**
- Compact badge showing "Demo Mode" with user type icon
- Info button opening detailed explanation dialog
- Quick exit functionality to return to login
- Visual distinction (colors/icons) between admin and user modes

**Placement**: Header/navigation area, visible on all pages when in guest mode.

### 6. Mock Data Implementation (`src/utils/auth/guestMockData.ts`)

Create comprehensive, realistic demo data:

#### Super Admin Mock Data:
```typescript
// Strategic business goals
goals: [
  "Launch BeProductive v2.0" (75% complete),
  "Scale Team to 50 Members" (45% complete),
  "Achieve $10M ARR" (62% complete),
  "Implement AI-Driven Analytics" (80% complete)
]

// Leadership habits
habits: [
  "Daily Strategic Review" (89-day streak),
  "Team One-on-Ones" (12-week streak),
  "Industry Research" (156-day streak)
]

// Executive analytics
analytics: {
  goals: 4 active, 0 completed, 0 overdue,
  tasks: 47 total, 32 completed, 3 overdue,
  habits: 3 active, 119 avg streak,
  productivity: 92 score, trending up
}
```

#### Regular User Mock Data:
```typescript
// Personal development goals
goals: [
  "Complete React Certification" (60% complete),
  "Build Personal Portfolio" (35% complete),
  "Run 5K Under 25 Minutes" (70% complete)
]

// Personal habits
habits: [
  "Morning Coding Practice" (23-day streak),
  "Evening Jog" (34-day streak),
  "Read Tech Articles" (67-day streak),
  "Meditation" (78-day streak)
]

// Personal analytics
analytics: {
  goals: 3 active, 0 completed, 0 overdue,
  tasks: 18 total, 12 completed, 1 overdue,
  habits: 4 active, 50 avg streak,
  productivity: 78 score, trending up
}
```

### 7. Protected Route Updates

Modify route protection to recognize guest users:

```typescript
// Allow access for both authenticated users and valid guest users
const hasValidAuth = user && (
  (isGuestMode && isGuestUser(user)) ||  // Guest user in guest mode
  (!isGuestMode && !isGuestUser(user))   // Regular user not in guest mode
);
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Specifications

### Color Schemes
- **Super Admin**: Purple theme (`#8B5CF6`, `#A855F7`) with crown icons
- **Regular User**: Blue theme (`#3B82F6`, `#2563EB`) with user icons
- **Demo Mode**: Orange accents (`#F59E0B`, `#D97706`) for development indicators

### Icons & Visual Elements
- **Guest Mode**: `TestTube` icon for demo/development context
- **Super Admin**: `Crown` icon for administrative privileges
- **Regular User**: `User` icon for standard access
- **Info/Help**: `Info` icon for explanatory dialogs

### Typography & Messaging
- **Clear Labels**: "Demo Mode", "Super Admin", "Regular User"
- **Helpful Descriptions**: Explain capabilities and limitations
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain business application standards
- **Development Context**: Clear this is for testing/exploration
