# Backup and Disaster Recovery Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the backup and disaster recovery procedures for the Spark Bloom Flow productivity application.

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

- **Database**: Daily backups at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Application Assets**: Weekly backups on Sundays at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Configuration**: Backed up on each deployment

### Backup Retention

- **Daily backups**: 7 days
- **Weekly backups**: 4 weeks
- **Monthly backups**: 12 months

### Storage Locations

- **Primary**: AWS S3 with versioning enabled
- **Secondary**: Google Cloud Storage (optional)
- **Local**: Recent backups for quick access

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

1. **Assess the situation**
   - Determine the scope of data loss
   - Identify the cause of the failure

2. **Find the appropriate backup**
   ```bash
   # List available backups
   ls -la ./backups/database/

   # Verify backup integrity
   ./scripts/backup/test-recovery.sh
   ```

3. **Restore the database**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   gunzip -c backup_file.sql.gz | psql $DATABASE_URL
   ```

4. **Verify data integrity**
   - Run application tests
   - Check critical user data
   - Verify recent transactions

### Application Recovery

1. **Rollback deployment**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   git revert HEAD
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Restore from backup**
   ```bash
   # Extract application backup
   tar -xzf application-backup.tar.gz

   # Rebuild and deploy
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Incident Detection**
   - Monitor alerts and health checks
   - Verify the scope of the issue

2. **Initial Response**
   - Activate incident response team
   - Enable maintenance page if necessary
   - Begin troubleshooting

3. **Communication**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Update status page
   - Post in incident channel

### Short-term Response (15 minutes - 2 hours)

1. **Problem Assessment**
   - Identify root cause
   - Estimate impact and recovery time

2. **Recovery Actions**
   - Implement immediate fixes
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Scale resources if needed

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track recovery progress
   - Monitor system health
   - Provide regular updates

### Long-term Response (2+ hours)

1. **Full Recovery**
   - Complete system restoration
   - Verify all functionality
   - Resume normal operations

2. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update procedures if needed
   - Implement preventive measures

## Testing and Validation

### Regular Testing Schedule

- **Monthly**: Backup integrity verification
- **Quarterly**: Full disaster recovery simulation
- **Annually**: Complete DR plan review

### Test Procedures

1. **Backup Verification**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup/test-recovery.sh
   ```

2. **Recovery Simulation**
   - Restore to staging environment
   - Verify application functionality
   - Test data integrity

3. **Communication Test**
   - Test alert systems
   - Verify contact information
   - Practice stakeholder notifications

## Contacts and Escalation

### Primary Contacts
- **DevOps Lead**: devops-lead@company.com
- **On-Call Engineer**: on-call@company.com
- **Infrastructure Team**: infrastructure@company.com

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Level 1**: Engineering team (0-30 minutes)
2. **Level 2**: Engineering management (30-60 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Executive team (60+ minutes)

## Compliance and Audit

### Requirements
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry-specific regulations

### Audit Trail
- All backup and recovery activities logged
- Change management documentation
- Regular compliance reporting

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) achievement
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) achievement
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
- Backup success rate

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly backup report review
- Quarterly DR plan updates
- Annual strategy assessment
