- Intent detection
- Keyword extraction

### 4. AI Chat Components
- **AIChatWidget**: Expandable chat widget
- **AIQuickActions**: One-click AI actions
- **AIInsightDisplay**: Productivity insights visualization

### 5. Predictive Analytics (`predictive-insights.ts`)
- Peak productivity hours analysis
- Task completion pattern detection
- Goal progress tracking
- Workload capacity warnings
- Habit effectiveness analysis
- Time estimation accuracy

### 6. AI Hooks (`useAI.ts`)
- **useAI**: Main AI functionality hook
- **useAIConfig**: Configuration management
- **useTaskExtraction**: Enhanced task parsing
- **useProductivityInsights**: Cached insights with auto-refresh

## NLP Capabilities
✅ date time extraction
✅ priority detection
✅ task categorization
✅ sentiment analysis
✅ intent recognition
✅ entity extraction

## Insight Types
✅ productivity patterns
✅ peak hours analysis
✅ task duration prediction
✅ goal achievement probability
✅ workload capacity warnings
✅ habit effectiveness

## Usage Examples

### Task Creation
```
User: "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 2pm about the project"
AI: Creates task with:
- Title: "Call John about the project"
- Due Date: Tomorrow 2:00 PM
- Category: "work"
- Confidence: 95%
```

### Productivity Insights
```
User: "How am I doing on my productivity?"
AI: "You're 73% more productive between 9-11 AM.
     Consider scheduling your most important tasks during this time."
```

### Smart Suggestions
```
User: "What should I work on next?"
AI: "Based on your deadlines and energy patterns,
     I recommend working on the marketing proposal.
     It's due tomorrow and you're most productive right now."
```

## Configuration

### Anthropic Claude Setup
```typescript
const config: AIConfig = {
  provider: 'anthropic',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307',
  maxTokens: 1000,
  temperature: 0.7
};
```

### OpenAI GPT Setup
```typescript
const config: AIConfig = {
  provider: 'openai',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  maxTokens: 1000,
  temperature: 0.7
};
```

## Security Considerations
- API keys stored securely (not in localStorage)
- Input sanitization for NLP processing
- Rate limiting for AI requests
- Fallback to local processing when AI unavailable
- Privacy-preserving analytics (local processing preferred)

## Performance Optimizations
- Message context limiting (last 20 messages)
- Cached insights with configurable refresh
- Lazy loading of AI components
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background processing for insights

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for AI service failures
- Local NLP processing as backup
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for temporary failures
- Offline functionality where possible

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for NLP utilities
- Integration tests for AI service
- E2E tests for conversational flows
- Performance tests for insight generation
- Accessibility tests for chat interface

## Next Steps
1. Add more AI providers (Google Bard, etc.)
2. Implement advanced voice features
3. Add multi-language support for NLP
4. Create AI training data from user interactions
5. Implement collaborative AI features
6. Add AI-powered scheduling optimization
