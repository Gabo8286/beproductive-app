## 🔧 **HOW TO USE YOUR NEW AI AGENTS**

### **Option 1: Via Web Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/admin/agents`
2. View real-time agent status
3. Use manual controls as needed

### **Option 2: Via Code Integration**
```typescript
import { agentOrchestrator } from '@/agents/agent-orchestrator';

// Start the agent system
await agentOrchestrator.start();

// Get system status
const status = await agentOrchestrator.getSystemStatus();

// Restart specific agent
await agentOrchestrator.restartAgent('monitoring');
```

### **Option 3: Via API Endpoints**
```typescript
import { getSystemStatus, forceHealthCheck } from '@/api/agents/status';

// Check system health
const health = await getSystemStatus();

// Force health check
const result = await forceHealthCheck();
```
